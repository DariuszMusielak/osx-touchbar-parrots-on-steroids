# osx-touchbar-parrots-on-steroids

I found this awesome and decided to add some new features to original version [osx-touchbar-party-parrot](https://github.com/mjaniszew/osx-touchbar-party-parrot):
- select type of parot
- click on ‚è∏ to pause parrot
- click on üî• to speed up parrot
- click on üëÆ to slow down parrot
- switch between parrot's types
